### Medicare Part D 2017 - Exploratory Analysis
This project is an analysis of Medicare Part D claims and spend to better understand the Rx behavior across the US. In this analysis, I make use of descriptive
statistics, histograms, bar charts, and map graphs (using folium) to analyze the breakdown of claims and spend by state, specialty, and drug. 

Note that in order to utilize this Jupyter Notebook, you need to download the Medicare Part D spending data from 2017 from the CMS website. This can be found here:
